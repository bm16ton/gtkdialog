Description: GUI-creation command-line utility based on GTK+ library
 Gtkdialog is a small utility for fast and easy GUI building. It can be used to
 create dialog boxes for almost any interpreted and compiled programs which is
 a very attractive feature since the developer does not have to learn various
 GUI languages for the miscellaneous programming languages.
 .
 The Gtkdialog utility uses the Glade Library to load, parse and execute Glade
 files. Gtkdialog makes the use of Glade created user interfaces convenient in
 a shell script or any other interpreted language.
 .
 Stand-alone, bash, and awk examples are provided.
